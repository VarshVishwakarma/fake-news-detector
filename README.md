📰 AI-Powered Fake News Detector

A web application built with Streamlit, leveraging machine learning and the Gemini API to detect whether a news article is likely real or fake.

🔍 Overview

This project provides a user-friendly interface for detecting fake news. Users can enter a topic of interest, and the app will:

Fetch the latest news article using the Gemini API.

Generate a concise AI summary.

Analyze the text with a pre-trained Logistic Regression model to classify it as Real or Fake.

✨ Features

Real-time News Analysis: Fetches and analyzes the latest news articles.

AI-Powered Summarization: Uses Gemini API to generate concise summaries.

Machine Learning Classification: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression for fake news detection.

Source Linking: Direct link to the original article for verification.

Simple Web Interface: Easy-to-use UI powered by Streamlit.

⚙️ How It Works

User Input: Enter a news topic (e.g., "global economy") in the text field.

API Call: App fetches the latest news related to the topic via Gemini API.

Summarization: Returns an AI-generated summary, title, and URL.

Text Transformation: Summary is converted using TF-IDF vectorizer (vectorizer.jb).

Prediction: Logistic Regression model (lr_model.jb) predicts:

1 → Real

0 → Fake

Display Results: Shows title, summary, authenticity prediction (color-coded), and original source link.
